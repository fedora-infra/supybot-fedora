###
supybot.replies.genericNoCapability: You're missing some capability you\
                                     need. This could be because you\

                                     you, or because the channel provides\

                                     because the global capabilities include\
                                     that anti-capability. Or, it could be\
                                     because the channel or\

                                     False, meaning that no commands are\

                                     capabilities. Either way, you can't do\

###
# Determines what message the bot replies with when someone tries to use

supybot.replies.incorrectAuthentication: Your hostmask doesn't match or your\

###
# Determines what error message the bot replies with when someone tries

###
supybot.replies.noUser: I can't find %s in my user database. If you didn't\

                        user is, and you'll need to identify before this\

# Default value: False
###
supybot.reply.error.noCapability: False

###
# Determines whether the bot will send error messages to users via

supybot.reply.showSimpleSyntax: False

###
# Determines what prefix characters the bot will reply to. A prefix
